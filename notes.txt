# Layoff Runbook

Being laid off can be overwhelming and it's easy to miss important tasks. This
runbook will help make sure you stay on track.

Note: this is primarily geared towards Software Engineers, although much of the
information is general enough to be applicable to any professional.

## Before you lose access to work systems
1. Make sure you can login to payroll with your personal email
  1. If you can't, make sure to download at least your last paystub
1. Make sure you can log in to your 401k with your personal email
1. Make sure you can log into any equity awards system with your personal email
1. Make sure your address and contact information are correct with the company
  1. You will still need to receive tax forms, and any error will be harder to correct after your last day.
Take notes on your accomplishments at your current company before you lose access (e.g. notes on your perf cycle self-reflections)
"Document your accomplishments: Make a list of your projects, contributions, and achievements during your time at the company. This information can be useful when updating your resume and LinkedIn profile."
Share contact info/LinkedIn request colleagues that you trust
Sign the severance paperwork ASAP as to not delay payments
Send Slack messages asking for LinkedIn endorsements from managers//asking if they will give be your reference check for your next job

## Just after you lose access to work systems
File for unemployment
Take a breath. Do what you need to do to relax (exercise, video game, music, etc)

### why layoffs specifically?
they are subtly different from voluntary departure; e.g. pinging people to be your reference check because you haven't landed new job
