# Layoff Runbook

Being laid off can be overwhelming and it's easy to miss important tasks. This
runbook will help make sure you stay on track.

Note: this is primarily geared towards Software Engineers, although much of the
information is general enough to be applicable to any professional.

# On your last day of work
## Before you lose access to work systems
1. Make sure you can login to payroll with your personal email.
    1. If you can't, make sure to download at least your last paystub.
1. Make sure you can log in to your 401k with your personal email.
1. Make sure you can log into any equity awards system with your personal email.
1. Make sure your address and contact information are correct with the company.
    1. You will still need to receive tax forms, and any error will be harder to correct after your last day.
1. Document your accomplishments
    1. Make a list of your projects, contributions, and achievements during your time at the company. This information can be useful when updating your resume and LinkedIn profile.
    2. If your company does performance reviews, your self-reflection may be a quick source to find highlights.
1. Connect with colleagues by sharing contact info and/or requesting to add them on LinkedIn.
1. If you are receiving severance, sign the necessary paperwork as soon as possible so that your first payment is not delayed.
1. While you still have access to Slack, ask your manager, previous managers, and/or colleagues you worked closely with if they would be willing to give a reference check for you for your next role
    1. Potentially also ask for endorsements on LinkedIn.

## After you lose access to work systems
1. If you're eligible, file for unemployment with the state
1. Take a breath. Do what you need to do to relax (exercise, video game, music, etc)
1. Remind yourself that you weren't the only one laid off, and that your company isn't the only one that's done layoffs recently:

# Starting a job search
## Decide how long you want to job search for
1. If you are in dire need of employment, take the first offer you get.
1. If you are in less dire of a situation, consider following a variant of the secretary problem, where you commit exploring before accepting. E.g. if you can spend 3 months job searching:
    1. Spend the first month interviewing and do not accept any offers.
    2. In the last two months, accept the first offer that is at least as good as the best offer from the first month.
1. The duration of your severance is a good starting point.

## Sign up on job marketplaces/boards for recruiter inbounds
1. Sign up for [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) and update your LinkedIn status to 'open to work'
1. Sign up for [Wellfound](https://www.wellfound.com) (formerly Angelist)
1. Sign up for [Hired](https://www.hired.com)

## Practice Technical Interviews
1. Technical Phone Screen
    1. Even if you can't solve or don't have time to solve, review solutions to familiarize yourself with common patterns (e.g. using binary trees, BFS/DFS, etc) for algorithmic interviews. The programming tasks are probably not like your day-to-day programming tasks, and it may take a while to adjust.
        1. Practice algorithm interview questions:
            1. [Leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com)
            1. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
            1. [Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net)
        1. General advice for technical interviews:

                1. [Resources Derived from CtCI](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cracking+the+coding+interview+summary&hps=1&ia=web)
    1. Mock interviews
        1. Ask trusted engineering contacts if they'd be willing to do a practice interview with you.
        1. Pay for a mock interview on [Interviewing.io](https://www.interviewing.io) to get the full CoderPad experience.
